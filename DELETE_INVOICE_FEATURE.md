# Delete Invoice Feature â€” Implementation Summary

This document summarizes all changes made to implement the Delete Invoice functionality in the Invoices Creator project. Use this as a reference if you need to revert the feature.

---

## 1. InvoicesList.html

- **Delete Button:**
  - The Delete button in the invoice list now redirects to the delete mode of the invoice form for the selected invoice.
  - Added a click handler to the Delete button that sends the user to:
    ```
    ?page=InvoiceGenerator&id=INVOICE_ID&mode=delete
    ```

---

## 2. InvoiceGenerator.html

- **Delete Mode Support:**
  - Recognizes `mode=delete` in the URL.
  - Title changes to `Invoice - Delete`.
  - The form is read-only.
  - Only the Delete button is visible below the form.
  - Clicking Delete opens a confirmation modal ("Are you sure that you want to delete?").
  - On Yes:
    - Shows a spinner.
    - Calls the backend to delete the invoice, its Google Doc, and PDF.
    - Redirects to the list of invoices after deletion.
  - On No: closes the modal.
  - If the document or PDF does not exist, a clear error message is shown.

---

## 3. dataService.js

- **New Function:**
  - `deleteInvoiceById(id)`
    - Finds the invoice row by ID in the "Invoices" sheet.
    - Deletes the Google Doc and PDF from Google Drive (with error handling).
    - Deletes the row from the sheet.
    - Returns a status for the frontend to handle.

---

## 4. Code.js

- **No changes were required.**
  - All functions in `dataService.js` are globally available to the frontend via Apps Script.

---

## How to Revert

- Remove the `deleteInvoiceById` function from `dataService.js`.
- Remove all delete-related UI and logic from `InvoiceGenerator.html` (Delete button, modal, spinner, and JS logic for delete mode).
- Remove the click handler for the Delete button in `InvoicesList.html` and restore the button to its previous behavior (if any).

---

**This feature enables safe, user-confirmed deletion of invoices, including their associated Google Doc and PDF files, directly from the invoice list.**
